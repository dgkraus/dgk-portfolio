# Personal Portfolio

A simple and interactive portfolio website built with **React** and **Next.js**, designed to showcase my projects and socials in a visually appealing way.

## About the Project

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey as a web developer, featuring a clean, minimalist design with fun animations that enhance user engagement. The goal is to create a site that has an interesting look and provides the information in a concise way.


## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: TBD

This portfolio is a work in progress, and I will add localized text and a better color scheme soon.
